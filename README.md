## Description

The program tries to predict whether a person would have a brain stroke or not. A stroke, also known as a brain attack, occurs when blood flow to a portion of the brain is obstructed or when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures. In both scenarios, sections of the brain suffer damage or cease to function due to this occurrence. Prevention is a crucial strategy to mitigate the risk of experiencing a stroke.
